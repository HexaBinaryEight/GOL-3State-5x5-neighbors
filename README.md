# main.cpp and MersenneTwister.h are the full sorce code. Feel free to depsaghettify main. Or I will do it myself, eventually. :P
Naturally you'll need SFML to compile this, else you can just study it and implement it using your own graphics and I/O or other programming language like Processing. SFML can be found at https://www.sfml-dev.org

HOW_DO_THINGS_YOU_CAN_DO.txt contains some UI info. Some details about how my implementation works is in main.cpp.

It's not perfect, but enjoy. <3
